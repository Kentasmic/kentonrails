      <p>Css is hard. It seems so easy at first but then there are soooo many quirks, bugs and browser specific 
      strangeness. but when it works, it is glorious. <label for="sn-it-is-glorious" class="margin-toggle 
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-it-is-glorious" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="sidenote">Still searching for the glory</span> I should probably look into a framework
      like tailwind css soon.</p>

      <p>I thought using Bridgetown RB would make this site much easier to make and update, but I find myself falling
       down yet another rabbit hole of arcane commands and quirks. As far as a static site generator, it seems quite
        good and it has been a useful exercise. Plus, there is the added bonus of the site ebing able to handle the
        massive traffic if a post goes viral! (Instead of 2 or 3 readers, maybe 12 people! :))<label for="sn-post-goes-viral" class="margin-toggle 
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-post-goes-viral" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="sidenote">He wishes he had 3 readers -ed.</span></p>
