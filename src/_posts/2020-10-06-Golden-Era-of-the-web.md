    <span class="newthought">The modern way of creating web apps</span> in 2020 is too hard. Too many javascript
    frameworks and way too much overall complexity. Not that it was ever super easy,
    but at least one person could reasonably create a decent site in a 
    relatively short period of time. There was a golden era about 15 years ago 
    <label for="mn-golden-era" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="mn-golden-era" class="margin-toggle"/>

        a very tiny amount of #2. When you get more comfortable, move on to #3 and #4.

    Right around this time Ruby on Rails appeared like the breath of proverbial
    fresh air. Since then, Rails has matured and become almost the boring old
    Grandpa of web dev frameworks. The best part of Rails was and still is the amazing
    community of people who love Rails. This year seems to be a bit of a Rails
    renaissance as Rails has added new features (Stimulus) and the community has stepped up
    and added fantastic new tools (<a href ="https://railsbytes.com" target="_blank">Rails Bytes</a>) and even new technologies like Stimulus Reflex,
    Cable Ready and View Components. With the success of Hey, there may be even more
    exciting tech extracted and added to Rails in the near future.

  <p>There has never been a better time to learn Ruby on Rails! I hope some
    of these posts help someone out there including future me!</p>
