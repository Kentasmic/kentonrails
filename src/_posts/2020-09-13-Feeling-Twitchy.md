    So the next version of Call of Duty Black Ops comes out soon and I saw some of the worlds best streamers showing off the latest version called Black Ops Cold War. One of them is called Noisy Butters

    and she had a nice comment on one of her videos. She said if anyone wants to stream, they should just stream. Start with what you have and just get started. Simple advice but hard
    to realize sometimes. The really good streamers have high end rigs worth 10's of thousands of dollars so you might think you need something similar but that is not so. My Playstion
    has streaming built in! Ideally, the upload speed of my internet connection should be 3-5 Mbps up but my current connection is only 1 Mbps up. I tried it anyway at lower broadcast settings
    and it was ok. Far from perfect but I am streaming and it is soooo much fun. I play anyway so I may as well stream because it makes it more fun knowing there is an audience watching and listening to what you do on screen.
