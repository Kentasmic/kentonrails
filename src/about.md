This is a collection of ideas, thoughts, tututorials and reminders with a focus on creating sites using the Ruby on Rails framework. There are also little tips and tricks and ideas about other aspects of web dev and life.


This site, like life, is lived in the margins. If you are reading on a phone, don't forget to expand the site by clicking on the sidenote numbers
and the &#8853; symbol for the gifs!

This particular site is built using Bridgetownrb with the Tufte css used for the overall look.
